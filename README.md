# spotter_ELD Route Mapper

- A React application for visualizing ELD (Electronic Logging Device) data on a map.

## What I managed to achieve.

- Displays ELD data using a free map API
- 📍 Plots ELD points and connects them with a route
- 🔄 Fetches real-time data from the Django backend
- ⚡ Built with React
- Deployment the app in Vercel

&nbsp;

## Prerequisites 🚀

### Before starting, ensure you have the following installed.

- **Node.js** (>= 16.x) – [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repo)

## Setup

Clone the repo and navigate to the frontend folder:

- `git clone https://github.com/dunnyk/spotter_ui.git` cd `spotter_ui`
- `npm install` This will install the dependencies.
- `npm start` to start the React app.

## What I Could Have Done Better

- Add a button on the map to allow users to type a location name directly.
- Update the API to dynamically fetch and display ELD points based on user input.
